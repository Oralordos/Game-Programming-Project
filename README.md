# Game Programming project

This is a project made over the course of a five month semester. It is a cooperative multiplayer dungeon explore game with a focus on puzzles. It is unlikely that there will be enemies in the dungeon, or very robust networking code.

Build with `go build -H "windowsgui"` when on windows to make the command line not show up.
